## personal additional tasks and features (bonus)

### additional base Functionalities
- add buttons or set up click and drag to; raise or lower an item through the list and order items around
- (optional)double clicking over a empty display item should reveal a input field

### guide
-set up default list called guide, which acts an exemplar, created by default for new users

### FIX non detrimental bugs
-set up "on()" loading, for lists(issue - needs research, conflicts with current angular, works as is currently)(assume on hold indefinatly)

###convert to different skeleton model and rebuild
- copy and past / save relative code to back up
- branch build
- set up and establish using "angularjs_starting_template" (https://github.com/tlkiong/angularjs_starting_template/) by T.L. kiong
- rebuild, update, and set up old code and convert old as needed to new template
- functionalize code into services and controllers where available and possible as needed

### beautify, and extend user log in
- change cover to also be a log in page
- clicking create new user should open up to a user creation page
  - user creation should allow user to connect with facebook, G+ or use an email or password
- (optional)move profile into a controller
- add ability to log in and sign up by Facebook (disable normal log in for now)
