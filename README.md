# AngularJS To Do List
a List to keep track of your items, tasks, and actions for the day

##instructions
create a user and log in via: facebook, G+ or email, to be able to create a series of todo lists
- entering your desired data into the field at the top will add items to the immediate bottom of the list
- a [x]/[trash] icon on every item will allow you to delete said item
- a [e]/[pencil] icon on every item will open a input field on said item to change its contents
- the [+] on every item icon will create a item ready to be edits immediately after said item
- [upward chevron] and [downward chevron] will allow you to move said item up or down the list as desired
- the tabs to the left allow you to flip between multiple lists
- above them the [+] will open up the list creation page where you may name the tab, and change the tab from its randomly selected colour, you will also be able to add  a string of tags, separated by a comma(,)
- a search bar to the left of that element will allow you to pair those lists down by name and tag
- the list will save by default after every change
